              <li>1/2 c. Mayonnaise</li>
              <li> 1 tsp. Old Bay seasoning</li>
           </ul>
         <strong><em><h4>Sandwich</h4></em></strong>
           <ul>
              <li>4 Sesame Seed Buns, sliced in half</li>
              <li>Ketchup</li>
              <li>Mustard</li>
              <li>1 Jar of Dill Pickles Slices</li>
              <li>1 Red Onion, sliced</li>
              <li>1 Tomato, sliced</li>
              <li>4 Leaves of Butter Lettuce</li>
           </ul>
       </ul>
      <strong><h3>The Steps to Cooking One Up</h3></strong>
       <ol>
        <li><b>Make the Burger Patties:</b> Heat a grill pan or saut√© pan over medium heat. As it heats, combine ground beef, Old Bay, pepper and salt. Form into four equally sized patties, about 1/3 lb apiece. Set on a platter next to the stovetop. Coat the warmed grill pan with cooking spray and place patties on the pan, cooking each side about 4-5 minutes, or until cooked through to your desired doneness. </li>
        <br><li>Use a large star-shaped cookie cutter to cut each cheese slice into a star shape. Place the star-shaped cheese on each burger patty, in the last 30 seconds or so of cooking, so it melts a little. Set burger patties aside.</li>
        <br><li><b>Make King Neptune's Poseidon Powder Aioli:</b> Stir mayo and Old Bay until thoroughly combined. </li>
        <br><li><b>Assemble the Sandwich:</b> Spread Poseidon Powder Aioli on the bottom of each bun. Top with a burger patty, ketchup, mustard, pickles, onion slices, tomato and lettuce. Place the top bun on each burger. Serve.</li>
      </ol>
