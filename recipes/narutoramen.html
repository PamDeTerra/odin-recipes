      <strong><h3>The Steps to Creating This Hearty Noodle Soup!</h3></strong>        
        <ol>
          <br><li>Rinse the chicken bones in cold water, then place them in a large pot with the water, pork, garlic, ginger, and green onions.</li>  
          <br><li>Bring to the boil, removing the dirt that comes to the surface. Lower the heat and simmer with the pot covered for around two hours.</li>
          <br><li>Remove the pork, then strain off the broth, getting rid of the other ingredients.</li>
          <br><li>Add the soy sauce, sake, and mirin, then leave to simmer with the pot covered until ready to serve.</li>
          <br><li>Mix the ingredients for the chashu sauce in a large pan. Add the pork, then bring to the boil over a medium heat. Cover with a lid, leaving slightly open so the steam can escape, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for around 30 minutes, turning the meat from time to time until just a little bit of liquid is left.</li>
          <br><li>Remove the lid, stay with the pan, and watch the liquid simmer until bubbles start to appear.</li>
          <br><li>Turn the pork to cover it completely with the sauce, then remove from the pan and slice thinly.</li>
          <br><li>When ready to serve, cook the ramen following the instructions on the packaging. Divide the broth into six bowls, then add the noodles, pork, bamboo shoots, soy-marinated eggs, and green onions.</li>
          <br><li>Serve hot!</li>
        </ol>
